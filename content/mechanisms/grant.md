Grants allocate funding through structured evaluation processes that typically include application submission, review periods, and staged disbursements. These processes can involve centralized committees, decentralized community voting, or hybrid models. Funding may be released in lump sums or tranches tied to milestone achievements, with evaluations often based on factors like project feasibility, team capability, potential impact, and alignment with program goals. Grants are particularly suited for fostering development in nascent ecosystems, basic research, and non-commercializable public goods.

The concept of grants comes from philanthropic and governmental funding for public goods and research initiatives. Many blockchain ecosystems, such as the Ethereum Foundation's grants program, use non-profit foundations to orchestrate grant disbursements and help their ecosystems grow. Onchain grants often take the form of voting on DAO proposals to disburse funds to service providers. While this can improve transparency and decentralization of decision-making power, it has also faced challenges in accountability due to a diffusion of responsibility in following up with grant recipients.

Advantages
- Public Goods Support: Can channel resources toward non-excludable and non-rivalrous goods, often neglected by traditional funding.
- Community Empowerment: Strengthens nascent web3 ecosystems by distributing resources to grassroots initiatives.
- Risk Management: Milestone-based disbursements ensure accountability and reduce upfront risks.

Limitations & Risks
- Review Bottlenecks: Resource-intensive application reviews can create delays, especially in decentralized environments.
- Adverse Selection: Proposals with strong narratives may outcompete higher-quality projects with weaker presentations.
- Milestone Gaming: Projects might prioritize meeting formal requirements over delivering substantive value.
- Sustainability Issues: Over-reliance on grant funding can hinder projects’ long-term financial independence and scalability, creating a vicious cycle.

Design Considerations
- Evaluation Framework: Ensure fair assessment criteria. Options include weighted scoring models (balancing feasibility, impact, and alignment), peer review systems (past grant recipients evaluate new proposals), and quadratic voting (favoring broad community support over large stakeholders).
- Disbursement Schedule: Enforce accountability through milestone-based disbursements, unlocking funds upon reaching goals, or continuous streaming, allowing real-time distribution with the ability to halt payments for non-delivery.
- Reviewer Incentives: Align interests with outcomes using performance-tied compensation (rewarding reviewers for long-term success), stake-backed review pools (requiring locked funds as a commitment), and blind review (reducing bias via anonymized applications).
- Application Streamlining: Maintain rigor while reducing friction through tiered applications (quick initial submissions, detailed reviews for finalists), pre-approved contributor pools (fast-tracking proven applicants), and template-based proposals (standardized formats for easier evaluation).
- Sustainability Mechanisms: Reduce reliance on grants via matching fund requirements (ensuring co-funding), progressive funding reduction (tapering support over time), and profit-sharing agreements (requiring successful projects to contribute back).
