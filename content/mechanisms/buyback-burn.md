Buyback & Burn uses protocol revenue to systematically purchase tokens from the open market. Once purchased, these tokens are permanently removed from circulation by being sent to an irretrievable address, making them unusable. The mechanism functions as a perpetual, autonomous buyer that never resells acquired tokens, creating constant buy pressure while simultaneously reducing the total token supply over time. Assuming a token’s market capitalization remains the same, the reduction in token supply should theoretically cause a proportionate increase in token price, thus enabling token holders to capture value in the form of unit price appreciation.

The mechanism is inspired by stock buybacks in traditional finance. Unlike corporate stock buybacks which can be reversed through new issuance, blockchain token burns are permanent and irreversible. MakerDAO pioneered this mechanism onchain, by requiring the stability fees from DAI loans to be paid by burning the equivalent in MKR tokens. Maker later transitioned this to a continuous auction system which separates the payment of stability fees from the buyback and burn operation. The success of this model led to widespread adoption across DeFi protocols as a way to align protocol revenue with token value appreciation.

Advantages
- Value Alignment: Directly ties token value to the revenue or profits generated by the platform, ensuring that token holders benefit as the ecosystem succeeds.
- Price Stability: Regular buybacks provide a price floor or cushioning effect during market downturns, potentially reducing price volatility.

Limitations & Risks
- Missed Capitalization Opportunities: Burning tokens eliminates the potential to reuse them for productive purposes, such as incentivizing contributors, raising funds, or supporting ecosystem expansion, which are key to sustainable growth.
- Market Distortion: The constant buying pressure may create artificial price floors that don't reflect true market conditions.
- Short-termism: The focus on scarcity and price increases can misdirect efforts from long-term network development to short-term price manipulation, risking the project’s sustainability.

Design Considerations
- Revenue Source: Define whether buybacks are funded by transaction fees, lending fees, protocol earnings, or other revenue streams.
- Buyback: Optimize buyback timing to avoid front-running or manipulation. Possible approaches include randomized buybacks, where purchases occur at unpredictable intervals to prevent price distortion, or algorithmic buybacks, where buy orders are triggered based on predefined metrics like token price volatility or liquidity conditions.
- Burn: Determine the proportion of tokens that should be permanently removed versus repurposed. Alternatives include partial burns, where some tokens are reallocated for staking rewards, governance incentives, or ecosystem growth, and auto-compounding models, where a portion of buyback funds is reinvested into yield-generating activities before burning.
