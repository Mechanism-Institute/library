description: "Video computing network where token holders can stake their LPT to participate in the network as orchestrators or delegators. Orchestrators are node operators who perform video transcoding work. They stake LPT as collateral to signal their commitment to the network. Delegators are token holders who don't want to run nodes and delegate their LPT to orchestrators, sharing in the rewards. The network distributes newly minted LPT as rewards to participants based on their stake and work performed. Misbehaving orchestrators can have their stake slashed, providing an economic incentive for good behavior."
