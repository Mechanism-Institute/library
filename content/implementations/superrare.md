name: "SuperRare"
description: "Implements one of the most comprehensive and strictly enforced royalty systems in the NFT space. The platform maintains mandatory 10% royalties on all secondary sales, which cannot be circumvented as trading is restricted to their proprietary marketplace smart contracts. This is complemented by their primary sales structure, where artists receive 85% of initial sales. The platform's focus on high-end, curated 1/1 artworks has helped justify and maintain these fixed royalty rates, as the higher average sale prices make the royalty percentages more palatable to collectors."
