name: "Kleros Court"
description: "Decentralized arbitration protocol that implements a multi-tiered appeal system where jurors are selected through stake-weighted sortition. When a dispute is created, parties must deposit dispute fees and provide evidence. After the initial ruling, parties can appeal by staking additional tokens. Appeals move cases to higher-tier courts, where more jurors with greater expertise review the dispute. Appeal fees increase with each round, making excessive appeals progressively more expensive."
