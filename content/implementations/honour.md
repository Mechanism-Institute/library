name: "Honour"
description: "Uses non-transferable HON tokens to represent reputation and mutual credit among users, redefining money as a measure of obligation rather than wealth. HON tokens are created when one user accepts another’s proposal and are non-transferable, making them individual liabilities rather than assets. The amount of HON held by a user reflects their reputation and level of obligation within the system. Transactions are consensual and designed to foster social bonds, with money created as needed and forgiven when no longer required. Users can forgive HON equal to the amount they hold, enabling a self-regulating mutual credit system. By blending non-transferable tokens with mutual credit principles, Honour challenges traditional money concepts, emphasizing community engagement, mutual obligations, and trust-driven, dynamic money creation based on social needs rather than market forces."
