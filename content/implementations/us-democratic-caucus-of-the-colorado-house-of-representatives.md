name: "US Democratic Caucus of the Colorado House of Representatives"
description: "In Spring 2019, the Colorado Democratic Caucus introduced quadratic voting in their State House of Representatives to prioritize budget allocation and legislative decisions. Each of the 41 caucus members received 100 virtual tokens to allocate across bills, with voting power scaling quadratically. The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act emerged as the top priority with 3,600 quadratic votes, followed by healthcare measures securing five of the top ten positions. However, in January 2025, a Denver District Court judge ruled that the system violated Colorado's open meetings laws due to its secret ballot nature, despite lawmakers arguing that final appropriations bills still required public hearings and debates."
