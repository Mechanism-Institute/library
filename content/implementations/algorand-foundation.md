name: "Algorand Foundation"
description: "Manages its grant process through a referral-based system organized by vertical focus areas (DeFi, Gaming, NFTs, Impact, and general ecosystem), with funding distributed in tranches based on milestone completions. Projects must provide regular updates and demonstrations of progress. Crucially, all major funding decisions go through the Foundation's on-chain governance system, where governors must send ZERO-Algo transactions with specific note formats (**af/gov1:j[idx,list-of-options]**) to vote while maintaining their committed ALGO balance throughout the quarterly governance periods to remain eligible for rewards."
