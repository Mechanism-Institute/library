description: "The first implementation of the Reversible ICO concept, which was launched in 2020 on Ethereum Mainnet. It featured a 22-day commit phase and 8-month buy phase, with an initial offering of 10 million LYXe tokens at 0.002 ETH (~$0.40) per token. Each month, the price increased by 0.0002 ETH (~$0.04) to incentivize early participation. A second batch of 10 million LYXe tokens was planned if the first batch sold out."
