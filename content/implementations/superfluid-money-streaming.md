name: "Superfluid Money Streaming"
description: "Formerly Constant Flow Agreement (CFA), it implements token streaming by wrapping standard tokens (e.g., USDC) into “Super Tokens,” (e.g., USDCx), streaming them at a sender-set rate—like 0.01 USDCx per second—from the sender’s live balance to a recipient. The sender’s balance decreases continuously, offset by any inflows, while the recipient’s grows, both tracked in real-time without pre-locking funds. Recipients withdraw anytime, and senders can adjust or cancel the stream, pulling from their live Super Token balance. This offers designers a dynamic, real-time payment tool for subscriptions or wages, with automatic netting of flows ensuring seamless updates."
