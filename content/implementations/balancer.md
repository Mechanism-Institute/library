name: "Balancer"
description: "Allows for multi-token liquidity pools of up to eight different assets, unlike traditional AMMs that only support token pairs. The system supports pools with customizable weight distributions, allowing users to create portfolios with flexible ratios like 80/20 or 40/30/30. When trades occur, the AMM automatically rebalances token prices to maintain the specified weight ratios in the pool. Public pools allow anyone to add liquidity but have fixed parameters. Private pools enable creators to customize token ratios, trading fees, and access controls."
