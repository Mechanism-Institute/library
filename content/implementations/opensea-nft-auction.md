name: "OpenSea NFT Auction"
description: "Implemented as ascending-price first-price auctions with timed endings. Bids must be 5% higher than the previous offer. A seller can cancel an auction at any time if they want to end it. Sellers can also choose to set a reserve price. This allows the auction to end without a sale if no bidders meet said price. The platform later introduced anti-snipe mechanisms that extend auction duration when last-minute bids are placed, addressing timing manipulation issues."
