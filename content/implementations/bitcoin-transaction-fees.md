name: "Bitcoin Transaction Fees"
description: "Implements dynamic fees where transaction costs fluctuate based on network congestion and block space demand. The fee calculation uses a \"satoshi per byte\" metric, where users pay based on their transaction's data size rather than the amount being transferred. During periods of high congestion, users compete for limited block space through a fee market, with miners prioritizing transactions offering higher fees per byte. This creates a self-regulating system where fees naturally adjust to balance network usage and transaction confirmation speed."
