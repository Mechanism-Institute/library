name: "Council by DELV (previously Element)"
description: "Element Finance’s implementation of voting vaults in its Council governance framework introduced a highly modular approach to token-abstracted voting. The system allows users to select from different vault types depending on how their assets are deployed. Each vault is designed to recognize and verify specific token positions—whether staked in Element pools, held in liquidity positions, or delegated to third-party strategies. Governance participants interact with a registry that tracks the vaults, ensuring that voting power is accurately distributed according to the user's active DeFi commitments. Element’s approach also introduced an on-chain mechanism to verify voting eligibility dynamically, preventing double voting across multiple vaults while ensuring that users retain full governance rights."
