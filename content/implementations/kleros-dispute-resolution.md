name: "Kleros Dispute Resolution"
description: "Implements a decentralized arbitration protocol where disputed transactions are resolved by randomly selected jurors who evaluate evidence and vote on outcomes. Jurors stake the platform's PNK token and earn fees for coherent judgments (those that match the majority), while losing stakes for divergent decisions. The system includes an appeal process where cases can be escalated to larger juror panels with progressively higher stakes, creating economic disincentives against sustained manipulation."
