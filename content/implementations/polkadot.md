description: "In its new OpenGov framework, implements conviction voting where users can vote \"Aye,\" \"Nay,\" \"Split,\" or \"Abstain\" on referenda, with voting power calculated by multiplying token amount by a conviction multiplier. The multiplier increases based on how long users lock their tokens, with one lock period being 28 days and the multiplier doubling up to six times for longer lock periods. Locked tokens remain available for staking but cannot be transferred. This mechanism prevents vote buying and gives smaller token holders the opportunity to increase their voting influence through longer lock-up commitments, with referenda typically running for 28 days unless fast-tracked by the Technical Committee."
