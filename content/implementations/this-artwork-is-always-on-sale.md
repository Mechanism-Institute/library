name: "This Artwork is Always on Sale"
description: "An artistic project by Simon de la Rouviere that implements Harberger Tax through two NFT versions with different patronage rates: the original 2019 version charges 5% annually on the owner's self-assessed value (currently 5.0 ETH), while the 2020 version charges 100% annually on a lower value (0.1 ETH). Both pieces require owners to always specify a sale price and continuously pay patronage fees to the artist based on their declared value, creating a perpetual royalty stream. The artwork must be sold to anyone willing to pay the declared price, effectively creating an always-on market that balances ownership rights with artist compensation."
