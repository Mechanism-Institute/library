name: "Foundation NFT Auction"
description: "When a seller lists an NFT, they set a reserve price and auction duration (15 minutes to 7 days). The auction only begins when a buyer places a bid meeting the reserve price. Once started, subsequent bids must be higher than the previous bid. To prevent sniping, any bid placed in the final 2 minutes automatically extends the auction by 5 minutes. This extension mechanism continues until no new bids are received within a 5-minute window. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins and must settle the transaction to receive the NFT."
