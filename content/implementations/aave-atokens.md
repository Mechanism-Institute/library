name: "Aave aTokens"
description: "aTokens are interest-bearing tokens issued by Aave when users deposit assets into its liquidity pools. Upon depositing assets, users receive aTokens that automatically increase in quantity as interest is accrued over time. For instance, if a user deposits 100 USDC and receives 100 aUSDC, their balance may grow to 105 aUSDC without any manual action required. This real-time yield distribution provides immediate visibility into accrued interest."
