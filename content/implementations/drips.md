description: "Applies the splitter mechanism to support open-source software funding by allowing users to create \"Drip Lists\" that continuously distribute payments to multiple projects, which then further split the funds among maintainers and dependencies according to configurable percentages. Funds flow continuously between addresses at a per-second rate, facilitated by a gas-efficient accounting system. Users deposit funds into the DripsHub contract, which manages the streaming balances and allows recipients to collect their accumulated funds with a single transaction. A splitter mechanism automatically redistributes incoming streams according to predefined ratios. A “squeezing” functionality enables anyone to trigger fund collection on behalf of recipients, ensuring uninterrupted flow of funds through the network."
