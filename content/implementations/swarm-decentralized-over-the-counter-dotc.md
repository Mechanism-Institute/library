name: "Swarm Decentralized Over-the-Counter (dOTC)"
description: "Enables institutional and retail investors to conduct large-scale trades on-chain without intermediaries, using smart contracts for secure, peer-to-peer transactions. The system replaces traditional OTC trading by holding assets in an escrow-like smart contract until all trade conditions are met, ensuring reduced slippage and eliminating counterparty risk. The recent dOTC V2 update introduces features like dynamic pricing tied to market oracles, instant order matching, improved discoverability, customizable trade terms, KYC selection for compliance, and affiliate rewards. Users can execute swaps or set limit orders."
