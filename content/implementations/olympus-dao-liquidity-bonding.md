name: "Olympus DAO Liquidity Bonding"
description: "Olympus DAO pioneered the concept of liquidity bonds by allowing users to exchange LP tokens or stablecoins for discounted OHM tokens. This system created a feedback loop where bond sales increased treasury assets, which in turn raised the protocol’s reserve floor value and the perceived intrinsic value of OHM. At its peak, Olympus maintained ownership of 99.5% of its liquidity and attracted significant market attention due to its high Annual Percentage Yield (APY), which incentivized users to stake OHM rather than sell. However, the model was heavily reliant on continuous bond sales to sustain rewards and high APYs, making it susceptible to reflexivity. As market conditions shifted and demand for OHM bonds declined, liquidity dried up, reducing the protocol’s treasury value and leading to a collapse in OHM’s price. This decline was further exacerbated by speculative trading and sell pressure from participants who had primarily bonded to take advantage of short-term arbitrage rather than contribute to long-term liquidity stability. As confidence eroded, Olympus’ treasury reserves became insufficient to support OHM’s valuation, leading to a massive devaluation from its all-time highs."
