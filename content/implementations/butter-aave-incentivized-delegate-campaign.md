name: "Butter <> Aave Incentivized Delegate Campaign"
description: "Aave’s incentivized voting pilot introduced a 3-month delegate campaign designed by Butter to improve DAO governance by compensating elected delegates for their work using a $15k grant and staking rewards. Delegates were elected through a competitive process where tokenholders staked AAVE to support candidates, with the winner receiving compensation and voting power to represent the community and work on strategic initiatives. The pilot aimed to address governance inefficiencies such as plutocracy, free-riding, and self-dealing by ensuring accountability, aligning delegate incentives with tokenholder interests, and encouraging broader participation in governance."
