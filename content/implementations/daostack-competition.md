description: "Reputation-weighted voting on competitive proposals. The system supports up to 100 winners with customizable reward distributions across multiple types including ETH, ERC20 tokens, and non-transferable reputation points. Competition creators can configure key parameters such as submission and voting periods, maximum votes per participant, and reward allocation percentages between winners. With features like tie-breaking mechanisms and a 90-day reward redemption window, this implementation served as a pioneering model for managing complex multi-winner competitions."
