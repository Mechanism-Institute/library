name: "Moloch DAO Rage Quit"
description: "Allows members to exit by burning their shares and reclaiming a proportional share of the DAO’s treasury. In V1, Ragequit was strictly a dissent tool, only available to members who voted “No” or abstained on a proposal during the grace period before execution, ensuring that those who opposed spending decisions could leave before funds were committed. V2 removed this restriction, allowing any member to Ragequit at any time, making the mechanism more flexible and introducing loot tokens, which separated governance power (shares) from financial claims (loot). V3 fundamentally changed Ragequit’s purpose by enabling investment-focused DAOs, where members could enter with capital and exit strategically to realize gains, rather than just to protest spending. This was supported by Lazy Ragequit, which reduced gas costs by allowing third parties to batch process exits, and by expanded asset support, including ERC-20s and NFTs. As a result, V3 transformed Ragequit from a governance escape hatch into an investment realization mechanism."
