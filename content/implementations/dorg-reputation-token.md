name: "dOrg Reputation Token"
description: "Implements a continuous inflation model for its internal coordination as a service DAO. The DAO mints reputation tokens proportionally to revenue earned by contributors, creating an automatic ownership-attribution system. This approach ensures that ownership shares (percentage of all tokens held) accurately reflect ongoing contribution rather than just historical participation. While members who become inactive retain their existing tokens, they face natural dilution as new tokens are minted to active contributors, creating strong incentives for sustained participation."
