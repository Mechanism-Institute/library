name: "Filecoin"
description: "Requires storage providers to stake FIL tokens as collateral to participate and earn rewards. Using Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt), providers must submit zk-SNARK proofs during 30-minute WindowPoSt deadlines to verify storage availability and integrity, with penalties like slashing imposed for failures. FIL collateral requirements scale with storage volume and include mechanisms such as initial pledge collateral, block rewards as collateral, and deal-specific collateral to align incentives. Block rewards are distributed through WinningPoSt, where providers with more storage power are likelier to earn FIL."
