description: "Implement a crypto-peg rather than stablecoin peg by creating an elastic supply mechanism pegged to Fantom token (FTM) price. Used protocol-owned liquidity in TOMB-FTM LP pairs to help maintain the peg. Introduced multi-token incentive design where TSHARE holders captured expansion profits."
