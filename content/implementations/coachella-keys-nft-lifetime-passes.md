description: "Coachella introduced the \"Coachella Keys,\" a collection of ten unique NFTs that grant lifetime access to the festival, along with exclusive VIP perks such as front-row access, luxury camping, and gourmet meals. Sold for a total of $1.4 million, these NFTs were initially marketed through a partnership with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Despite facing challenges due to FTX's collapse, which left NFT owners unable to access their tokens, Coachella has committed to honoring the benefits associated with them."
