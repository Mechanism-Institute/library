name: "Wildcards NFTs"
description: "Applied Harberger Tax to create a sustainable conservation funding platform where users become \"guardians\" of wildlife NFTs representing real or symbolic animals. Each token is perpetually for sale, requiring guardians to set a selling price and continuously pay a percentage-based tax on that value, with proceeds flowing directly to conservation organizations. If guardians fail to maintain their tax deposits or someone purchases their token at the stated price, ownership transfers, creating a dynamic system that ensures continuous funding for wildlife conservation through onchain transactions."
