name: "BrightID"
description: "Utilizes a web of trus**t** by constructing a decentralized social graph where cryptographically signed connections between users serve as proof of identity. The system analyzes these connections to detect and prevent Sybil attacks, using algorithms such as SybilRank to distinguish between genuine users and fake identities. Trust propagates through the network from preselected seed nodes (trusted individuals or groups). Applications can integrate BrightID to verify unique identities."
