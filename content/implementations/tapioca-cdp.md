name: "Tapioca CDP"
description: "Implements an overcollateralized lending system where users can mint USDO stablecoin by depositing collateral at a minimum ratio of 110%. The protocol primarily accepts network gas tokens (like ETH) and Liquid Staking derivatives (stETH, rETH) as collateral, with each position being isolated to minimize risk. It employs a variable interest rate mechanism based on the Collateral Debt Ratio (CDR), with rates typically ranging from 5% to 10%. The system operates through two main markets: Big Bang markets for primary collateral types and Singularity markets for riskier assets."
