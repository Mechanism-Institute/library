name: "Perishable USD (PUSD)"
description: "A proposed uncollateralized stablecoin design that uses a 5% annual demurrage rate as its core stability mechanism. When the price rises above $1, the protocol prints new PUSD as helicopter money, while price drops below $1 trigger natural supply contraction through the continuous demurrage decay."
