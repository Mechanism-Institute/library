name: "Cosmos Hub Proposals"
description: "Implements a comprehensive proposal framework with three main types: parameter changes for blockchain modifications, text proposals for strategic decisions, and community pool spend proposals for treasury allocation. Each proposal requires a minimum deposit of 250 ATOM and follows a three-phase process: a 14-day deposit period where anyone can contribute, a 14-day voting period with four options (Yes, No, No with Veto, and Abstain), and an execution phase. Proposals pass when they achieve a 40% quorum, receive more than 50% \"Yes\" votes, and less than 33.4% \"No with Veto\" votes. The system features delegator vote inheritance from validators and restricts voting power to staked ATOM holders only, excluding liquid ATOM from participation."
