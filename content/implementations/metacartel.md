description: "MetaCartel employs a community-driven grant mechanism to support early-stage projects within the Ethereum ecosystem. The process begins with aspiring projects submitting proposals detailing their goals and potential impact. These proposals are then shared on the MetaCartel Forums, where community members can discuss and provide feedback. Once discussions conclude, the community votes onchain on whether to support the proposal. Successful proposals, which garner more votes in favor than against, are awarded grants ranging from $1,000 to $10,000."
