name: "Harberger Toolkit"
description: "A comprehensive smart contract framework that implements configurable Harberger Tax mechanisms for various use cases. The toolkit enables developers to deploy tokens with customizable parameters including tax periods, minimum coverage requirements, and fee distributions. Notable applications include community-building through taxed PFP (Profile Picture) NFTs that fund collective treasuries, self-regulating app subscription models where token values adjust with demand, and art tokens with guaranteed royalties that cannot be circumvented through wrapper contracts. The system allows administrators to fine-tune economic incentives by adjusting tax rates, beneficiary shares, and holding periods, creating flexible implementations that can either minimize or encourage speculation based on specific needs."
