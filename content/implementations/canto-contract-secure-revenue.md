name: "Canto Contract Secure Revenue"
description: "Ethereum L2 that allows developers to earn a share of transaction fees generated by their smart contracts. Developers register their contracts with the CSR Turnstile smart contract to receive CSR NFTs, which represent the right to claim revenue. Revenue accrues automatically to these NFTs whenever users interact with the registered contracts, and NFT owners can withdraw funds at any time. Multiple contracts can share a single NFT, enabling aggregation. CSR eliminates the need for user-facing fees, aligning with Canto’s ethos of Free Public Infrastructure while providing developers with sustainable, decentralized income."
