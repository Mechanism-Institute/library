description: "Launched in 2016, the protocol offers both transparent and shielded addresses, with the latter enabling users to selectively disclose transaction details through \"viewing keys\" for compliance or audit purposes. This selective transparency is achieved through zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), which allow transaction verification without revealing the underlying data."
