name: "Cozy Finance"
description: "Modular risk management protocol that allows users to create automated protection vaults covering specific DeFi risks. Protection buyers select coverage conditions that trigger payouts automatically through smart contracts, while providers deposit assets into liquidity pools to underwrite risks and earn yield from premiums. The protocol enables permissionless market creation, allowing users to define custom protection parameters. Payouts are triggered based on predefined on-chain events, eliminating manual claims processing. Cozy Finance integrates with DeFi protocols, such as lending markets and automated market makers, offering flexible and composable protection solutions."
