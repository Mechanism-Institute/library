name: "Purple"
description: "A Farcaster Public Goods DAO that demonstrates how the Nounish model can support ecosystem development. Purple provides funding for public goods, apps, bug bounties, protocol contributors, and community events that bolster the Farcaster user base. It operates independently from the organization developing the protocol and was established permissionlessly. As the protocol's usage grows, new individuals join the Farcaster ecosystem daily, discover Purple, and compete at auction to get more involved in the protocol, resulting in a constant stream of new members."
