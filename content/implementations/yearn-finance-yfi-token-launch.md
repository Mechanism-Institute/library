name: "Yearn Finance YFI token launch"
description: "In July 2020, Yearn Finance introduced its governance token, YFI, through a unique liquidity mining initiative. Unlike traditional token launches, Yearn Finance distributed 100% of the 30,000 YFI tokens to users who provided liquidity to specific pools on platforms like Curve and Balancer. Participants could earn YFI by supplying assets to these pools and staking the resulting liquidity provider tokens in Yearn’s contracts."
