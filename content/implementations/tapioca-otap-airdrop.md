name: "Tapioca oTAP Airdrop"
description: "Innovated on traditional airdrop mechanisms by implementing the first-ever call option airdrop through airdropped oTAP (aoTAP), an American-style call option with a 48-hour expiry. The distribution occurred in four distinct phases targeting different user groups: LBP Contributors received a 50% discount on 1.5M TAP, Guild members got 25-50% discounts on 500K TAP, Pearl Club NFT holders received a 50% discount on 500K TAP, and twTAP lockers were offered a 33% discount on unclaimed TAP over four 7-day epochs. Unlike traditional free airdrops, participants had to pay to exercise their options, which helped deter Sybil attacks while generating Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) for the Tapioca DAO Treasury. The mechanism raised over $2 million in additional POL."
