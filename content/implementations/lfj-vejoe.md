description: "Previously known as Trader Joe,** **this project adapted the revenue share model for their JOE token. Protocol fees are used to buy JOE tokens distributed to veJOE holders. Enhanced the basic model by implementing Curve’s vote-locking mechanics, where more extended lock periods result in higher reward multipliers, encouraging long-term alignment. Later, they transitioned from time lock boosting to simply staking for a share of revenue, with revenue distributed in USD stablecoins rather than JOE tokens. The benefit of this is that there is less sell pressure on stakers looking to realize profits."
