name: "Polygon ID"
description: "A self-sovereign identity solution built on the Polygon blockchain, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for private, decentralized identity verification. Users can prove identity attributes without revealing personal data. Polygon ID is the first project to implement the W3C Verifiable Credential Refresh chapter. Trusted entities (issuers) create and issue VCs, which are cryptographically signed and linked to a Decentralized Identifier (DID). Users store VCs in a non-custodial identity wallet and can selectively disclose specific attributes (e.g., age > 18) using ZKPs instead of exposing entire credentials."
