description: "Facilitates NFT-based subscriptions with unique features like subscriber rewards and referral incentives. The platform allocates a percentage of subscription revenue to an on-chain pool, where early subscribers who make longer-term commitments receive larger shares of the rewards, creating an incentive for early adoption and long-term engagement. Creators can use Hypersub to distribute various types of content, including monthly raffles, early mints, limited edition drops, group chats, newsletters, and access to IRL events, with subscription prices typically ranging from 0.002 to 0.02 ETH per month."
