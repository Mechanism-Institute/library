name: "Uniswap UNI Airdrop"
description: "Pioneered retroactive token airdrops, distributing 15% of the total UNI supply at genesis to early users, liquidity providers (LPs), and SOCKS holders without vesting or lock-ups. Using a Merkle tree for efficient whitelisted address verification, the airdrop allocated 400 UNI per account that interacted with Uniswap contracts, tokens to LPs based on time and value of liquidity provided, and 1,000 UNI to SOCKS holders. However, analysis found that 93% of recipients sold their tokens, with 75% selling within the first week, and only 7% still holding UNI at the time of analysis. The airdrop failed to decentralize governance, as the majority of large UNI holders today are not airdrop recipients."
