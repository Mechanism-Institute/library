name: "The DAO Split Mechanism"
description: "Implemented a split mechanism in 2016 that allowed participants to withdraw their ETH proportional to their DAO tokens if they disagreed with proposals. The process required creating a \"child DAO\" that would receive the split portion of assets, with a 28-day creation period during which the funds were locked."
