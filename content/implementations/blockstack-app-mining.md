name: "Blockstack App Mining"
description: "Pilot program that incentivized developers to build dApps on its platform by distributing Stacks (STX) tokens based on app rankings. Apps were evaluated monthly by independent reviewers using criteria such as user experience, privacy, and alignment with decentralization principles. The ranking determined each app’s share of a fixed STX reward pool. Developers could improve their app’s performance to earn higher rewards. However, the program faced challenges in creating unbiased ranking metrics, preserving user privacy in analytics, and transitioning to a decentralized governance model, leading to its pause for restructuring."
