name: "dYdX Retroactive Mining"
description: "Allocated 7.5% of the total DYDX supply to early protocol users based on their historical trading activity prior to July 26, 2021. The distribution implemented a tiered reward system where users who traded at least $1 received 310 DYDX tokens in the lowest tier, while those who traded over $1 million received 9,529 tokens in the highest tier. The tokens became transferable on September 8th, 2021, after a 28-day epoch period. When trading began, DYDX opened at $10.28 and reached an intraday high of $14.24, making even the smallest tier distribution worth approximately $4,414 at launch. This retroactive distribution became one of DeFi's most notable airdrops, with some users receiving rewards valued at over $100,000 based on launch prices."
