name: "IQ Protocol"
description: "A rental protocol that creates wrapped tokens representing time-based usage rights of original assets. The system implements a unique \"powertoken\" model where renters can access utility tokens for specific timeframes without collateral. The protocol handles automatic return mechanisms through smart contracts and enables flexible fee structures, including fixed-price and variable-pricing models based on usage duration. Asset owners maintain custody through a protocol-managed vault system, while renters receive wrapped versions with built-in expiration."
