name: "Helium BME"
description: "Employs BME through its native token, Helium Token (HNT), to balance supply and demand dynamically. Users burn HNT to obtain non-transferable Data Credits (DC) for network services, reducing the HNT supply. Simultaneously, the network mints new HNT tokens, distributing them to participants like hotspot operators who provide coverage and other services. This model ensures real-time adaptation to usage patterns, as increased demand for services (and corresponding token burns) raises HNT value, while controlled minting maintains equilibrium."
