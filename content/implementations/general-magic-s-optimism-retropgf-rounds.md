name: "General Magic's Optimism RetroPGF Rounds"
description: "The mechanism allowed Optimism badgeholders to compare projects in pairs, creating an intuitive way to signal preferences. Through these rounds, participants evaluated projects based on their relative merit rather than absolute ratings, which reduced cognitive effort and improved voter engagement. The system’s use was extended across rounds, with improvements such as more structured lists and better participant feedback loops to refine the allocation process further."
