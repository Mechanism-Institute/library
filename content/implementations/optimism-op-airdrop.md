name: "Optimism OP Airdrop"
description: "Implemented a pioneering multi-phase token reward system that distributed 11.7 million OP tokens (worth approximately $28 million) to over 300,000 active participants in its governance system. The protocol's second airdrop in February 2023 specifically targeted governance participation, with 6.8 million tokens allocated to governance rewards and 2.5 million for gas fee rebates. Qualifying wallets needed at least 2,000 total \"Tokens x Days\" delegated, with rewards scaling at 0.42/365 OP per Token-Day up to 5,000 OP per address. The system also included multiplier bonuses - addresses that spent ≥ $20 on gas fees received a 2x bonus, while those with ≥ 54,367 total 'OP Delegated x Days' received a 1.1x bonus. The mechanism successfully increased participation, particularly among smaller token holders, and led to more dispersed delegation patterns, with concentration metrics (HHI) dropping from 2,277 to 710 after implementation."
