name: "The Park"
description: "A creative collective showing how Nounish DAOs can align cultural production with governance. The DAO's members are collaborators and fans of a band called The Park, and together, they curate a unique onchain music experience. The Park hosts \"Fridays at The Park,\" a recurring event that brings together music collaborators and web3 thinkers to create music in the studio and engage in dinner discussions, often centered around web3. DAO members gain access to a token-gated live stream of the event. The recorded sessions are expertly edited and released as NFTs through DAO Proposals. The Park's members, being both fans and collaborators, are highly aligned around the vision and eager to participate in shaping the future of music. Creative DAOs enjoy the advantage of releasing art and music, which expands the fan base and attracts a steady influx of new members eager to join the DAO."
