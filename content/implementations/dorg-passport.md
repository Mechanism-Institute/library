description: "Implements a comprehensive DAO membership system using a Passport NFT (ERC-721) that represents core membership. The Passport can only be minted, moved, or burned by the DAO through governance decisions. The system creates a linked identity structure where non-transferable Reputation tokens (ERC-20 with voting capabilities) and achievement Badges (ERC-1155) automatically \"follow\" the Passport when ownership changes. This orchestrated migration ensures that a member's entire reputation profile, voting power, and achievements remain cohesively bundled, creating an effective non-transferable identity system while allowing for DAO-controlled membership transfers."
