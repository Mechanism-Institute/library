name: "FOAM"
description: "Implemented TCR as a decentralized mapping system where Points of Interest (POIs) are validated through a crypto-economic model. The system operates with three key actors: Candidates who submit POIs with FOAM token deposits, Cartographers (token holders) who vote on submissions, and Consumers who use the registry. When a POI is submitted, it enters a challenge period where token holders can dispute it by matching the deposit, triggering a community vote. Successful listings remain on the map with staked tokens, while failed submissions result in token redistribution to successful challengers and voters. The system includes flexible parameters such as minimum deposits, voting periods, and reward distributions, with the unique feature of allowing partial stake withdrawal after successful listing and market-driven deposit amounts."
