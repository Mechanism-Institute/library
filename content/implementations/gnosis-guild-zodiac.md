name: "Gnosis Guild Zodiac"
description: "Implements a modular role-based access control system through its Roles Modifier component. The system enables DAOs to define granular permission structures, allowing specific roles to execute transactions on behalf of the organization. Permissions can be set based on target contracts, function signatures, and parameter constraints, providing precise control over role actions. Its modular architecture integrates RBAC with other governance tools, such as time delays, multi-signature requirements via Safe, or event-based execution through the Reality Module, enabling customized governance systems tailored to organizational needs."
