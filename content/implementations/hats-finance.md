description: "Operates a decentralized bug bounty protocol with several unique features: Non-custodial vault system where projects create bounty pools using their native tokens and pay-for-results model where projects only pay fees (20%) when vulnerabilities are discovered. There are two competition types: public competitions open to all auditors with first-come-first-served submissions and private competitions restricted to whitelisted auditors for stealth projects. It relies on an onchain submission system that filters spam and ensures only high-quality reports reach project teams. Hats Finance has stated that it will integrate with Kleros for decentralized arbitration."
