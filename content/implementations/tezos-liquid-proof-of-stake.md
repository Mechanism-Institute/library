name: "Tezos Liquid Proof-of-Stake"
description: "Implements sortition through its \"Liquid Proof-of-Stake\" consensus where bakers (validators) are randomly selected to propose and validate blocks. The mechanism uses a deterministic pseudo-random number generator seeded by data from previous blocks to ensure unbiased selection. Selection probability is proportional to a baker's stake, requiring a minimum of 6,000 XTZ to participate. The system includes a \"roll\" concept where every 6,000 XTZ equals one roll in the selection lottery."
