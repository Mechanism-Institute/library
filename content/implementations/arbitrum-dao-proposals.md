name: "Arbitrum DAO Proposals"
description: "Implements a comprehensive seven-step proposal process that begins with a one-week temperature check on the community forum, followed by a formal submission requiring 5 million delegated $ARB tokens within a 3-day window. The proposal then enters a 14-16 day voting period where it must achieve both a majority of \"Yes\" votes and meet specific thresholds: 5% of $ARB votes for Constitutional AIPs or 3% for Non-Constitutional AIPs. For the initial temperature check phase, proposers need 0.01% of votable tokens to create a Snapshot poll, while formal on-chain submission through Tally requires 1 million tokens. The process allows for delegate assistance if proposers don't meet token thresholds, and includes mandatory waiting periods between phases to ensure thorough consideration of each proposal."
