description: "Implemented a points system before their token launch to incentivize early user engagement and activity. Users could earn points through various activities on the platform like higher trading volumes or successful referrals. Points were calculated weekly and distributed every Friday. When the V2 launched, a portion of the project’s token supply was airdropped to points earners."
