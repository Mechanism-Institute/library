name: "Sherlock"
description: "Implements a three-party audit marketplace system where protocols seek audits, stakers provide coverage, and security experts (called Watsons) perform audits. Protocols can receive smart contract coverage of up to 50% for both white-hat bounties and black-hat exploits. Stakers deposit USDC to earn yield from protocol premiums and SHER token incentives. Security experts compete in audit contests with dedicated prize pools, with top performers promoted to Senior Watson status. Additionally, Sherlock employs a three-tiered dispute resolution system for bug bounties: starting with a Sherlock team member as judge, escalating to a 7-member Protocol Claims Committee for a $1,000 fee, and culminating in the UMA Optimistic Oracle as final arbitrator for a $15,000 fee. Before escalation, parties can engage in a 14-day supervised negotiation period, promoting efficient dispute resolution while maintaining professional conduct."
