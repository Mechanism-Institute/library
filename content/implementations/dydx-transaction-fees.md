name: "dYdX Transaction Fees"
description: "For trading, it applies volume-based fees that differ whether you are a ‘maker’ (who provides liquidity by placing limit orders) or a ‘taker’ (who consumes liquidity by executing market orders). For makers with monthly volumes under $100,000, the platform offers zero trading fees to encourage participation. Above this threshold, maker fees range from 0.02% to 0%. For takers, fees span from 0.05% to 0.2%, with rates decreasing as trading volume increases. The platform also implements percentage-based fees for other services, including free deposits, a 0.1% fee for fast withdrawals of maximum $25,000, and a 1% liquidation fee. This comprehensive approach incentivizes higher trading volumes while maintaining platform sustainability."
