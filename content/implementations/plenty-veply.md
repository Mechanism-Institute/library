name: "Plenty vePLY"
description: "Allows users to lock PLY tokens and receive vePLY, an ERC-721 NFT representing their locked position. Lock durations range from one week to four years, with longer durations granting proportionally greater voting power and rewards. vePLY holders can vote on the distribution of weekly PLY emissions across liquidity pool gauges, claim trading fees and bribes from pools they support, and boost their liquidity rewards by up to 2.5x. Weekly emissions are dynamically adjusted based on the circulating supply, decreasing emissions as a higher percentage of PLY is locked, thereby incentivizing long-term locking. To prevent dilution, locked PLY supply is inflated proportionally to weekly emissions, maintaining vePLY holders’ governance and economic influence. The tokenized vePLY positions are tradable on secondary markets and support merging, splitting, and collateralization."
