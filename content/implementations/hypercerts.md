description: "Function as a standardized, interoperable data layer for impact certificates, implemented as semi-fungible tokens (ERC-1155) on blockchain networks. They create immutable records of who performed what work, when it was done, and what impact was achieved, enabling both prospective and retroactive funding for positive impact work. The system allows contributors to mint certificates defining their impact claims, which can then be evaluated, fractionalized, merged, or split across six dimensions including scope of work, time of work, and scope of impact. This structure creates a shared, decentralized database for impact funding mechanisms while enabling multiple evaluations of each impact claim, helping to establish transparent markets for social good and facilitating better coordination between funders."
