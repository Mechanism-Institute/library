name: "Nouns Prop House"
description: "Launched as an onchain community funding platform that transforms traditional grant programs into competitive rounds. The system uses two key components: Houses (collections of funding rounds) and Rounds (actual competitions). Each round can distribute ETH, ERC20 tokens, or NFTs to winners, with voting conducted on Starknet for cost efficiency. The platform features both timed rounds with specific proposal and voting periods, and infinite rounds that run until finalization."
