description: "The protocol implemented quadratic voting in their \"Maeve\" upgrade to improve cross-chain security and decentralization in its proof-of-stake network. A validator’s voting power is proportional to the square root of their stake, making it progressively harder for validators to accumulate excessive influence as their stake increases. This mechanism ensures that smaller validators retain a meaningful voice, enhancing the decentralization and security of cross-chain transaction validation. Validators must collectively coauthorize cross-chain requests based on this quadratic-weighted voting, preventing domination by validators with large stakes while maintaining robust network liveness and safety."
