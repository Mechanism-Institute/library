name: "MetaDAO"
description: "Platform for futarchy-based DAOs that uses prediction markets to evaluate proposals based on their expected impact on token value. It consists of three parts: (1) a conditional vault managing speculative tokens with reversible trades, (2) an Automated Market Maker with TWAP oracle for manipulation resistance, and (3) an autocrat program that coordinates the entire proposal process based on market signals."
