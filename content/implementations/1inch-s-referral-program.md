name: "1inch's Referral Program"
description: "Created a multi-tiered referral program where users earn 1INCH tokens based on the trading volume generated by referred users. The program integrates with 1inch's aggregation API, allowing integrators to collect a portion of transaction leftovers, while smart contracts automatically track referrals and distribute rewards. Both referrers and referred users receive benefits through a points-based system, with additional bonuses provided for KYC verification, and the rewards are funded through fees paid to 1inch by affiliate liquidity sources. The system includes built-in protections against self-referrals and gaming attempts through KYC requirements."
