description: "Implemented a token-weighted voting system where voting power is directly proportional to the amount of MKR tokens held. To participate, MKR holders must \"lock up\" their tokens in the Voting Contract, receiving IOU tokens in return and having their voting weight added to their chosen candidates. The system employed continuous approval voting, allowing competing proposals to be introduced at any time while maintaining an active Executive Vote where MKR holders can shift their votes between proposals. Through this mechanism, token holders made decisions on crucial protocol parameters including stability fees, collateral types and rates, budget allocation, and organizational structure."
