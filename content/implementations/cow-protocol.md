name: "CoW Protocol"
description: "Implements batch auctions for decentralized trading, allowing for multi-asset swaps and MEV protection. The protocol collects and aggregates orders off-chain and settles them in batches. These batches are then auctioned off to solvers who offer the most surplus for the orders, ensuring uniform clearing prices and minimizing the risk of MEV extraction."
