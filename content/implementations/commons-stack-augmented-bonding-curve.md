name: "Commons Stack Augmented Bonding Curve"
description: "Integrates additional mechanisms to address some of the limitations and risks of traditional bonding curves. It includes a reserve pool to stabilize the token price and a funding pool to support community projects. It also incorporates a vesting mechanism to prevent early speculation and a governance model to ensure that the funding is allocated to initiatives that benefit the community. The curve can be polynomial or another complex function, depending on the specific implementation."
