name: "Kleros Jurors Sortition"
description: "Implements a multi-layered sortition system for decentralized dispute resolution. Jurors stake PNK tokens in specific subcourts (e.g., general, technical, financial) and are randomly selected using a commit-reveal scheme for random number generation. Selection probability is weighted by both stake amount and subcourt specialization. The protocol implements an appeal system where each subsequent round requires more jurors, selected through the same sortition process but with higher stakes required."
