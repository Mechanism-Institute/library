name: "Optimism Citizen’s House Veto Power"
description: "According to the OPerating Manual, the Citizens’ House can block proposals approved by the Token House. After the Token House passes a proposal, the Citizens’ House has a one-week veto period to review it. During this time, Citizens can vote to veto proposals, such as protocol or governor upgrades, by meeting a specified veto threshold based on the total number of Citizens. If the veto threshold is met, the proposal is not enacted. This mechanism ensures an additional layer of oversight and prevents unilateral decision-making by the Token House."
