name: "Bittensor Yuma Consensus"
description: "Implements peer review for validating AI model outputs through a weighted matrix system. Validators evaluate miner responses across metrics like speed, intelligence, and diversity, aggregating their assessments into a stake-weighted consensus. The system incentivizes validators to align with majority opinions by reducing rewards for those who deviate significantly from consensus, while increasing the influence of consistent validators over time. Miners receive rewards based on their performance scores from the validator consensus, creating a self-reinforcing mechanism where high-quality contributions are rewarded and poor performance is naturally filtered out through reduced economic incentives."
