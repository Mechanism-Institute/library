description: "Implements an automated, governance-free revenue sharing model through a pre-configured smart contract that operates like a digital vending machine with three core parameters: token price, token split, and cash out tax. When users pay into the system (through fundraising or revenue), the contract issues tokens at a set price, with a configurable percentage automatically split off to designated entities like builders. All funds remain in the contract backing token value, and token holders can only access these funds by returning their tokens to the contract in a cash-out process that incurs a tax. This tax increases the underlying value for remaining token holders, creating an incentive to hold longer. The system features deterministic rules that change over pre-specified time periods and includes liquidity management by forwarding funds to AMMs when they offer better rates than the contract's issuance price."
