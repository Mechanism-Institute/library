name: "Olympus DAO POL"
description: "Pioneered POL through its bond mechanism, where users can sell LP tokens or single-sided assets to the protocol at a discount in exchange for vested OHM tokens. The vesting period, typically 5-10 days, prevents immediate sell pressure while allowing the protocol to gradually accumulate liquidity positions. Through this mechanism, Olympus has achieved ownership of the majority of its OHM-DAI liquidity, enabling it to capture trading fees and maintain price stability without relying on external liquidity providers."
