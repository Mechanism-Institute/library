name: "Decred PoS Voting"
description: "Pioneered incentivized voting in blockchain governance through its hybrid PoW/PoS system, where ticket holders receive 89% of block rewards for participating in governance decisions. The system requires stakeholders to lock DCR tokens to purchase tickets, which grant voting rights on both protocol changes and treasury spending through the Politeia platform. Tickets are selected pseudorandomly with an average 28-day voting period, and successful voters receive both their original stake and rewards, creating a strong economic incentive for long-term participation in governance."
