name: "BTC Supply Curve"
description: "Pioneered programmatic inflation in blockchain through its mining reward system. Starting with 50 BTC per block, rewards halve approximately every four years, creating a diminishing inflation schedule. This model implements a deflationary approach with a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins, making it the first example of programmatic monetary policy. Once the maximum supply is reached, no new tokens will be created, transitioning the system to a purely deflationary model."
