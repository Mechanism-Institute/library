name: "Polymarket"
description: "Operates on the Polygon blockchain and uses binary outcome markets. Users wager in USDC and receive outcome tokens (e.g., YES/NO) representing their chosen side of a prediction. At market resolution, winning outcome tokens become redeemable for 1 USDC each, while losing tokens become worthless. Polymarket leverages a CLOB, supplemented by a FPMM as a fallback to maintain liquidity. Markets are resolved via the UMA Optimistic Oracle. Liquidity is incentivized through a rewards program for market makers who contribute to the CLOB, enhancing accuracy and user participation."
