name: "Nexus Mutual"
description: "Discretionary mutual insurance protocol where members pool capital to cover smart contract vulnerabilities, custody risks, and yield token failures. The system uses a membership-based model where NXM token holders control risk assessment and claims processing. Risk Assessors stake NXM tokens on specific smart contracts they believe are secure, earning rewards for accurate risk evaluation and facing penalties if their assessed contracts fail. Coverage pricing is dynamically determined by multiple factors including the requested coverage amount, time period, current capital utilization, and the amount of NXM staked against the contract. Claims undergo a decentralized governance process where members vote to approve or deny payouts based on evidence and coverage terms, with voting incentives aligned to promote accurate assessments. The protocol implements a capital model that ensures solvency while optimizing capital efficiency across different risk categories."
