name: "DeSci Nodes"
description: "Implements research objects as verifiable scientific publications that combine manuscripts, code, data, and other research artifacts into a coherent unit of knowledge stored in a decentralized repository. These research objects maintain a reference to a tree of arbitrary data, similar to a file hierarchy, which is publicly available on IPFS and includes components like research papers, presentations, code, and data necessary to reproduce the claims of the publication. Each research object has a manifest that contains pointers to the data DAG and object information, with version control capabilities that ensure every version has a unique identifier while remaining independently traceable through the protocol. The system provides features such as open content resolution, storage, provenance tracking, data cataloging, secure persistent identifiers (PIDs), and compute capabilities, all aimed at improving scientific reproducibility and transparency."
