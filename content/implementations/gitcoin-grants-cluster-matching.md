name: "Gitcoin Grants Cluster Matching"
description: "Implemented “Cluster-Matching Quadratic Funding (QF),” a mechanism that combines quadratic funding with correlation discounts to address collusion and Sybil attacks. This approach, also known as Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching (COCM), analyzes the social connections and similarities among donors to adjust matching funds accordingly. By evaluating how connected donors are—through shared affiliations, donation patterns, or other social metrics—COCM reduces the influence of coordinated groups attempting to manipulate funding outcomes. This ensures that projects with genuine, diverse community support receive appropriate matching funds, promoting fairness and reflecting the true values of the community."
