name: "DAOstack Voter Rewards/Penalties"
description: "Allows DAOs to configure reputation rewards specifically for members who vote with the winning side, and reputation slashing for those who vote with the losing side. Voters use their non-transferable reputation to vote on proposals, knowing they'll receive additional reputation if they select what most others select (and lose reputation for voting against the majority). This creates a direct incentive to vote based on what one believes others will decide, rather than arbitrary preferences."
