name: "Edgeware Lockdrop"
description: "Commonwealth Labs pioneered the lockdrop mechanism with Edgeware in 2019, distributing 90% of EDG tokens through a unique two-option system. Participants could either lock their ETH for 3, 6, or 12 months (\"Lock\") or signal their intent to participate without actually locking funds (\"Signal\"). The protocol allocated 4.5% of tokens to Commonwealth Labs for development, while the remaining tokens were distributed through the lockdrop."
