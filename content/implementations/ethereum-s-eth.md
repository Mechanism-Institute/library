name: "Ethereum's ETH"
description: "Initially introduced as a native token for paying transaction fees (gas). Users must acquire ETH to interact with the Ethereum network, whether deploying smart contracts, sending ETH, or transacting with smart contracts. With EIP-1559, token burning was introduced as an enhancement to the original payment token model. With the move to proof of stake, Ethereum also introduced staking as a secondary utility for ETH, requiring long-term holding to secure the network and earn rewards. This dual utility significantly reduced token velocity and enhanced value capture, setting a precedent for combining payment functionality with additional mechanisms."
