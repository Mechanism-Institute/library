name: "Smart Invoice"
description: "Originally developed by Raid Guild as an internal tool, Smart Invoice was later funded by MolochDAO to serve as a public good for the Web3 ecosystem. It implements a milestone-based cryptocurrency escrow system that securely manages payments between clients and service providers. Funds are locked in a smart contract and released progressively as predefined project milestones are completed, ensuring payment security throughout the project lifecycle. The system also includes anti-fraud measures to prevent chargebacks and wallet errors, while disputes are resolved through an integrated arbitration mechanism with a capped fee structure."
