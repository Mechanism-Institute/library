name: "Splits SplitV2"
description: "Launched in May 2024, SplitsV2 can receive ETH or ERC20 token payments and distribute them among a fixed group of recipients based on preset ownership percentages, offering \"Push\" and \"Pull\" options to suit different needs. In the Push model, funds are sent directly to recipients when distribution is triggered, while the Pull model holds funds in a separate Warehouse, letting recipients withdraw their shares independently. Each Split acts as a unique wallet with an owner who can pause distributions or make transactions, adding flexibility. This setup separates splitting logic from fund storage, streamlining automated, precise distributions for use cases like DAO payouts or team funding, with recipients either receiving funds automatically or managing their own withdrawals."
