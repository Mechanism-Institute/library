name: "Balancer veBAL"
description: "Instead of locking the native BAL token directly, users must provide liquidity to an 80/20 BAL/ETH pool and lock the resulting Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT). This design maintains BAL's liquidity while creating stronger protocol alignment. Balancer limits the maximum lock period to one year. The system distributes 75% of protocol revenues to veBAL holders and uses a gauge system for liquidity mining where veBAL holders vote on pool incentives across multiple chains."
