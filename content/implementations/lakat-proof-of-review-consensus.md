name: "Lakat Proof-of-Review Consensus"
description: "Lakat is a protocol that allows users with an Ethereum key-pair to publish content in a continuous integration fashion, using the Ethereum ecosystem as a storage anchor and through tokens that track activity. Lakat leverages a \"proof of peer review\" process where contributors to a branch (similar to journal editors) engage in reviewing submissions. The protocol adds new blocks to branches based on these peer reviews, creating a blockchain-like structure where blocks consist of reviewed changes rather than transactions. This process is backed by a consensus mechanism called Lignification, which is localized to branch contributors and operates in tandem with the open review process."
