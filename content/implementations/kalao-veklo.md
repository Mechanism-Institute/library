name: "Kalao veKLO"
description: "Implemented time-boosters in their staking system through the introduction of veKLO (vote-escrowed KLO) and esKLO (escrowed KLO). When KLO tokens are staked, veKLO balances automatically increase over time, which not only boosts the staker’s share of marketplace fees but also their voting power, with the maximum bonus of 300% achievable after 183 days. This bonus accrues linearly every second, incentivizing long-term staking. Unstaking any amount of KLO results in the forfeiture of all accumulated bonuses. Additionally, stakers receive rewards in the form of esKLO, which can be vested back into KLO over 183 days but does not earn rewards during the vesting period."
