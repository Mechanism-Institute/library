name: "USDT"
description: "Maintains a 1:1 peg with the US dollar through a reserve-backing system. For every USDT token in circulation, Tether maintains an equivalent amount of US dollars or dollar-equivalent assets in reserve accounts. When users want to obtain USDT, they deposit US dollars, and Tether mints new USDT tokens; conversely, when users want to redeem USDT, they can exchange their tokens for US dollars, and those tokens are removed from circulation. This system operates across multiple blockchain networks like Ethereum, Tron, and Solana."
