description: "Initially supported creator royalties of up to 10% on all secondary sales. In late 2022, amid market competition and the rise of zero-royalty marketplaces, OpenSea introduced the Operator Filter Registry - a tool for creators to block their NFTs from being listed on marketplaces that don't honor royalties. By August 2023, they shifted to an optional model where buyers can choose whether to pay creator royalties."
