name: "GMX"
description: "Allows stakers to accumulate Multiplier Points (MPs) and escrowed GMX (esGMX), which provide both enhanced economic returns and the opportunity to participate in governance through DAO voting. Staking GMX and GLP tokens earns users a portion of the trading fees generated by the platform, with these fees being converted into GMX through a buyback mechanism. Over time, as tokens are staked, users accrue MPs which increase the rewards from these activities, rewarding long-term commitment with greater economic benefits. Recent community-endorsed changes have modified this system by reducing the Multiplier Points (MPs) accrual rate from 100% to 50% APR and introducing caps on MPs to prevent long-term stakers from gaining overwhelming advantages. Additionally, esGMX can be staked to earn similar rewards to GMX, or vested over a year to convert into actual GMX."
