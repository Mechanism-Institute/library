description: "Uses a web of trust by requiring new participants to receive an invite code from an existing verified user before joining. This creates a trust-based entry system that connects new users to the broader network through human verification. Once in the system, users must participate in synchronous validation ceremonies, where they solve human-generated CAPTCHA-like “FLIP” challenges to prove their uniqueness. These challenges require logical reasoning and creativity, making them resistant to AI automation. The invite mechanism helps maintain Sybil resistance by ensuring that fake identities are difficult to create in large numbers. Additionally, existing users are incentivized to invite only genuine participants since their reputation and rewards depend on maintaining network integrity."
