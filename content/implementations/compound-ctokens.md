name: "Compound cTokens"
description: "Interest-bearing tokens in the Compound protocol represent user deposits and serve as the primary means of interaction with the protocol. When users supply assets to Compound, they receive cTokens which automatically earn interest as the underlying pool accrues fees from borrowers. There are two types: CErc20 for ERC-20 assets and CEther for ETH. The exchange rate starts at 0.02 and increases based on the market's interest rate - for example, if you supply 1,000 DAI when the exchange rate is 0.0200, you receive 50,000 cDAI. When the exchange rate grows to 0.0215, your same cDAI tokens would be redeemable for 1,075 DAI."
