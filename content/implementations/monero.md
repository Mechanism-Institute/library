description: "Launched in 2014, the protocol employs ring signatures that obscure transaction origins by combining the sender's signature with other potential signers, making it statistically impossible to determine the true source. The system uses stealth addresses to generate unique one-time addresses for each transaction, preventing address clustering and transaction linking. Additionally, Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) hide transaction amounts while allowing selective disclosure through view keys that can be shared with specific parties for compliance or auditing purposes."
