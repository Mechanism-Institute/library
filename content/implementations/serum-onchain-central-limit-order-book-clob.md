name: "Serum Onchain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)"
description: "Users place orders with specific prices and sizes, similar to traditional centralized exchanges, but in a fully decentralized and non-custodial environment. The order book and matching engine operate entirely onchain, leveraging Solana’s high throughput and low latency to ensure efficient order matching and execution. To optimize for Solana's account size limitations, Serum implements a cranking mechanism where separate transactions handle order matching, event processing, and garbage collection of filled orders."
