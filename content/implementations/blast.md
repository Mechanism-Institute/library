name: "Blast"
description: "Utilizes a point system to drive user engagement and liquidity. Blast Points can be earned primarily by bridging assets to the Blast mainnet, inviting friends to participate, and trading tokens. The amount of Blast Points earned is proportional to the wallet balance of bridged assets, with point earnings growing over time due to Blast’s native yield generation. Users can earn point “boosts” through referrals, secondary referrals, and tiered trading volumes. This system encourages direct participation and network growth, contributing to Blast’s rapid adoption and high Total Value Locked (TVL)."
