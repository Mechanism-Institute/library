name: "Ethereum Base Fee"
description: "Introduced in EIP-1559 and implemented in 2021, this mechanism dynamically adjusts transaction base fees to manage network congestion. The base fee increases by up to 12.5% when blocks are above the gas target (15M) and decreases by the same maximum percentage when below target. The system burns all base fees, creating a deflationary pressure that increases with network usage."
