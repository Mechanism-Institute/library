description: "Auto-compounding receipt token for FARM stakers. The protocol takes performance fees from its yield farming strategies, uses these to purchase FARM tokens on the open market, and distributes them to the Communal Harvest pool over 24 hours. As a result of the 24-hour time delay, the instantaneous reward rate for the pool fluctuates over the day."
