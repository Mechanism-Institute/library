description: "Each profile has a personal token bonding curve (i.e., “creator coin”) tied to their reputation that any user can buy and sell. Profiles can share revenue with their token holders by selling goods and access to services that share revenue with the curve, thereby increasing the token redemption price. Creator coins are designed to be naturally scarce, typically ranging from 100 to 1,500 coins per profile. As more people buy a creator's coins, the price increases at an accelerating rate, following a quadratic bonding curve formula."
