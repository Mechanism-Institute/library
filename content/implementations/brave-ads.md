name: "Brave Ads"
description: "In this proof of concept, QAP is used to accurately value user engagement by giving power to the users to curate their own advertising experience. By integrating with Brave's existing attention-tracking features, QAP introduces a quadratic voting scheme where users vote for ads they prefer. The resulting quadratic fees become a revenue stream for advertisers and act as an incentive for creating higher-quality, more relevant ads. This aims for an ecosystem where users are exposed to fewer but more personalized ads, publishers and advertisers gain enhanced targeting insights, and revenue is more equitably distributed among all stakeholders."
