name: "SAFE Vested Airdrop"
description: "Distributed 5% of its total token supply to users based on past contributions and usage, with half available immediately and the rest vesting linearly over four years. A proposal to unlock tokens (Snapshot vote SEP #2) failed, but months later, the community voted to redistribute unclaimed tokens to first-round claimants (Snapshot vote SEP #5). The tokens were initially non-transferable until approved by a vote from SafeDAO in September 2024 (Snapshot vote SEP #22), discouraging dumping and incentivizing participation."
