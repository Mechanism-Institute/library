name: "Privacy Pools"
description: "First proposed in early 2023 as a response to regulatory challenges faced by earlier mixing services like Tornado Cash. The system introduces a decentralized approach to list management that enables users to selectively interact with counterparties based on customizable inclusion/exclusion criteria. The system allows individuals to manage their own lists of approved or blocked entities or to delegate this responsibility by adopting lists curated by trusted \"association set providers.\" When users withdraw from privacy pools, they can generate zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating that they aren't associated with any addresses on specific exclusion lists, proving compliance without revealing their actual transaction history. This approach creates a novel middle ground between full permissionlessness and rigid centralized control, allowing for regulatory compliance while preserving user autonomy."
