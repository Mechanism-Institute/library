description: "Offers several key parameters to manage proposal support and fund allocation: “convictionGrowthHours” controls how quickly support for a proposal charges up over time, with a lower number allowing faster buildup of conviction. The “spendingLimit” parameter restricts proposals to requesting no more than a certain percentage of the total funds available, limiting the maximum financial impact any single proposal can have. The “minThreshold” ensures that all proposals meet a minimum conviction threshold, preventing spam and ensuring proposals have significant backing. Lastly, the “minEffectiveStake” defines the minimum percentage of total token supply that must be active in voting to validate the conviction calculations, ensuring a broad base of support."
