name: "BNB Token"
description: "Operates one of the most comprehensive token burn programs, utilizing multiple mechanisms. The Auto-Burn System, introduced in December 2021, replaced the original quarterly burns by automatically calculating burn amounts on-chain based on BNB price and block generation, with a target to burn 100 million BNB (half of the total supply). The Real-Time Burn (BEP-95), implemented in November 2021, continuously burns a portion of gas fees from each block and will persist even after the 100 million BNB target is reached. Additionally, the Pioneer Burn Program removes extra BNB equivalent to provably lost user funds, with these amounts counted toward the quarterly burn total."
