description: "First elastic supply token implementation, targeting a USD value ($1.009) using CPI data. The protocol employs daily rebases based on 24-hour TWAP from Chainlink price feeds, incorporating a \"lag factor\" to smooth supply changes. If the price deviates more than 5% from the target, a rebase event proportionally adjusts token balances in all holder wallets."
