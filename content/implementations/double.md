name: "Double"
description: "Utilizes both the ERC-4907 and ERC-5006 standards. The protocol creates a \"doNFT\" that represents the usage rights for a specified rental period. When a renter pays the agreed fee, a doNFT is minted, granting them access to the original NFT's functionalities while retaining ownership with the original holder. At the end of the rental term, the doNFT automatically expires, revoking the renter's usage rights without requiring additional transactions. This structure facilitates efficient NFT rentals and promotes a marketplace for utility-focused NFTs."
