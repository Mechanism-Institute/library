name: "SudoSwap GDA"
description: "Uses discrete GDA for NFT liquidity pools. Their implementation treats each NFT sale as part of a continuous sequence of mini Dutch auctions, where the starting price of each subsequent auction is determined by the previous sale price and time elapsed. This approach helped solve the challenges of NFT liquidity by allowing prices to automatically decrease during periods of low demand while quickly adjusting upward after sales, preventing rapid depletion during high demand."
