name: "Blind Spot Auction"
description: "Employs a first-price sealed-bid auction mechanism designed to address issues of fairness and transparency in NFT art sales. Participants submit their bids confidentially, ensuring that no bidder has access to the information about other bids during the auction. At the end of the bidding phase, all bids are revealed simultaneously, and the highest bidder wins the auction, paying the exact amount they bid."
