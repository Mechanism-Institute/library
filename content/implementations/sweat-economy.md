name: "Sweat Economy"
description: "Sweat Economy implemented its \"one person, one vote\" mechanism in April 2023 for a governance vote to allocate 100 million SWEAT tokens, allowing each eligible liquid token holder—excluding team members, investors, and founders—one equal vote regardless of their SWEAT holdings, conducted directly within the Sweat Wallet app on the NEAR Protocol. This broke from traditional token-weighted voting by ensuring fairness across its 15 million token holders, deciding between staking rewards or burning tokens to influence supply, with the process designed for accessibility and transparency."
