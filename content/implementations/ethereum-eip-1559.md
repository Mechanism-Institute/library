name: "Ethereum EIP-1559"
description: "Adopted and activated on August 5, 2021, as part of Ethereum’s London Hard Fork. It incorporates a burn mechanism where a portion of transaction fees (the base fee) is permanently removed from circulation, creating a deflationary effect similar to traditional buyback and burn models. Unlike buybacks that rely on treasury income to repurchase tokens and signal confidence, EIP-1559’s burn is intrinsic to the protocol and tied directly to network usage, not treasury management."
