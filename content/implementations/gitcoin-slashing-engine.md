name: "Gitcoin Slashing Engine"
description: "A proof-of-concept mechanism designed to enhance sybil resistance within Gitcoin’s ecosystem by penalizing fraudulent accounts attempting to exploit identity-based systems like Gitcoin Passport. Participants can stake Gitcoin’s native token (GTC) to become guardians, gaining the ability to flag accounts they suspect to be sybils. The system requires a quorum of guardians or a predefined staking threshold—set dynamically by Gitcoin’s DAO—to confirm a claim before slashing occurs, ensuring collective validation and reducing the risk of false positives. If a flagged account is confirmed as a sybil, it is penalized by losing access to associated resources, while malicious or inaccurate guardians can themselves be slashed through a community vote mechanism."
