description: "Pioneered the StableSwap AMM curve, optimized for assets with similar prices, such as stablecoins or wrapped tokens. This design minimizes impermanent loss and reduces price volatility compared to traditional AMMs that pair different assets. Curve implements a custom formula that concentrates liquidity around the current \"internal oracle\" price. The protocol includes an ERC20-compliant LP token system for pool participants. When pools become unbalanced, the system automatically adjusts prices to incentivize trades that restore balance."
