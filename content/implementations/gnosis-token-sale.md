name: "Gnosis Token Sale"
description: "In 2017, Gnosis conducted one of the first Dutch auctions for a token sale, raising $12.5 million in just 10 minutes. The rapid completion time and high valuation demonstrated both the effectiveness and potential limitations of the Dutch auction format. While successful in price discovery and fundraising, the speed of completion suggested that the starting price or decay function might have been suboptimally calibrated, leading to fewer price points being explored than intended. This implementation became a reference point for subsequent token sales and influenced the development of more sophisticated Dutch auction variants."
