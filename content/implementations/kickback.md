name: "KickBack"
description: "Uses slashing to enforce attendance in RSVP-based events. Participants stake tokens when registering, which are forfeited if they fail to attend and distributed among those who showed up. This ensures commitment and reduces free-riding behavior, aligning incentives in decentralized event coordination."
