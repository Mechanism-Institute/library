description: "Implements token-weighted voting through a process that spans five distinct periods, collectively taking around two and a half months. Token holders (or their delegates) leverage their holdings of XTZ tokens to influence governance. The process starts with a “proposal period,” where delegates can submit and support protocol amendment proposals. Proposals with the highest support that meet a quorum threshold proceed to an “exploration period,” during which voting occurs on whether to advance them. If quorum and a super-majority are achieved, the proposal moves into a “cooldown period” for additional scrutiny, followed by a “promotion period” for further voting. Proposals that achieve the necessary thresholds in these stages enter an “adoption period,” during which approved changes are automatically implemented into the protocol."
