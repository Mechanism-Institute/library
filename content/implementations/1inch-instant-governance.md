description: "1INCH token holders can influence real-time protocol parameters like transaction fees and liquidity pool settings. Users can update the values they desire for any system variable at any given time, and the system aggregates these inputs in real-time using a weighted average. As a result, the system’s parameters are adjusted without formal proposals or voting cycles."
