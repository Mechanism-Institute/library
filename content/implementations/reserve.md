name: "Reserve"
description: "Functions as a platform for creating customizable reserve-backed stablecoins called RTokens. Each RToken is backed by a basket of collateral assets managed through smart contracts that automatically maintain the required backing. The system uses a dual-token model with RSR (Reserve Rights Token) serving as the protocol's insurance and governance token. When an RToken's collateral becomes compromised, the protocol can automatically substitute assets through its basket manager or recapitalize by auctioning RSR tokens. Anyone can deploy their own RToken with custom parameters including collateral types, ratios, and revenue models. The protocol incorporates a unique collateral default protection mechanism that allows for the seamless swapping of backing assets when necessary, enabling RTokens to maintain stability even if individual collateral components fail."
