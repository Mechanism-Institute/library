name: "Kleros Escrow"
description: "Built on Ethereum, Kleros’ Escrow is a decentralized application enabling secure transactions between parties with a unique dispute resolution process. Buyers’ funds (ERC20 tokens) are locked in a smart contract via the createTransaction() function, requiring the sender’s approval. The contract offers three resolution paths: the sender can pay() to release funds, the receiver can reimburse() the sender, or disputes can be initiated by paying arbitration fees. Arbitration fees can also be paid via crowdfunding. If a dispute arises, the case is resolved by jurors from Kleros’ dispute resolution system."
