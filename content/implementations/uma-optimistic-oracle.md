name: "UMA Optimistic Oracle"
description: "Applies the optimistic model to data validation. Rather than requiring immediate verification of every data submission, UMA’s system assumes data is correct unless challenged. When a proposer submits a price or other data point, it is automatically accepted after a predefined challenge period (often 2 hours) unless a dispute is raised. If challenged, the dispute escalates to UMA’s Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), where token holders vote to determine the correct value."
