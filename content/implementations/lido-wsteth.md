name: "Lido wstETH"
description: "An ERC-20 token that serves as a wrapper for stETH (staked ETH), designed specifically for compatibility with DeFi protocols that do not support rebasable tokens. Unlike stETH, which adjusts its balance daily based on staking rewards (rebasing), wstETH maintains a constant balance while reflecting its value through an increasing exchange rate with stETH over time. When users convert their stETH into wstETH, they lock in the current value of their staked ETH. This process allows them to participate in various DeFi activities without losing out on staking rewards due to balance fluctuations."
