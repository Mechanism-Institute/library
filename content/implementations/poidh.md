name: "POIDH"
description: "POIDH (\"pics or it didn't happen\") allows anyone to create micro-bounties to pay others for completing real-world tasks. The protocol operates through a three-step process: 1) creator escrows tokens to create a bounty; 2) claimant submits visual proof of task completion through a photo; 3) creator reviews submissions to either accept (transferring funds to the claimant) or reject them. The system employs visual verification as the proof mechanism, creating a privacy-preserving marketplace for micro-tasks. When a creator accepts a submission, they receive the proof photo as an NFT while the claimant receives the escrowed payment."
