name: "dOrg REP-based bonus"
description: "When clients compensate dOrg with their native tokens, these tokens are distributed to members proportionally based on their historical work contributions as tracked by their reputation score (Rep). While Rep is a permanent record of all work performed, only \"active members\" (those who have earned Rep in the current fiscal quarter) are eligible for token distributions. This means bonuses are shared proportionally to total Rep among active members only, preventing dilution from historically active but currently inactive members. This creates a direct link between a member's patronage (work contributed) and their dividend (share of project tokens) while ensuring value timing alignment."
