name: "Optimism Citizens' House"
description: "Implemented as part of Optimism's bicameral governance system, the Citizens' House gives equal voting power to each verified human participant. Working alongside the token-weighted Token House, this structure balances democratic principles with economic incentives, creating a hybrid governance model that addresses the limitations of both pure one-person-one-vote and pure token-weighted systems."
