name: "Ants Review"
description: "Onchain peer review protocol that issues bounties for academic paper reviews while maintaining reviewer anonymity. Authors upload papers to IPFS and issue bounties in ANTS tokens, which reviewers can claim by submitting quality reviews. The system uses zero-knowledge proofs via the AZTEC protocol to maintain double-blind privacy while enabling financial incentives. Uniquely, Ants-Review also incorporates community voting on review quality, creating a self-reinforcing ethical framework where the entire scientific community participates in validating both papers and their reviews, effectively solving the \"who reviews the reviewers\" problem while expanding the available pool of qualified assessment."
