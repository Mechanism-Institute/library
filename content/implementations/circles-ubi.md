name: "Circles UBI"
description: "Built on Gnosis Chain, it enables participatory currency creation. Users receive 1 Circle (CRC) token per hour automatically and can mint their own personal currency at the same rate. All tokens are automatically demurred at a rate of 7% per year. To join the network, new participants need verification from three existing trustees, implementing a \"web of trust\" mechanism where connections between users enable token flows throughout the network. The platform's v2 contracts leverage the ERC-1155 token standard, supporting multiple token types including personal, group, and organizational currencies. Circles provides reference implementations for minting, burning, and redeeming group currencies, allowing for custom policy creation."
