name: "Circles Demurrage"
description: "Implements a 7% annual demurrage rate as a core mechanism to maintain fair distribution of purchasing power. While users continuously mint new tokens at a fixed rate, the demurrage ensures that those who accumulate large balances face natural dilution over time. This creates an equilibrium where balances above 120,804 tokens experience net decay while smaller balances grow, helping maintain economic participation across the network."
