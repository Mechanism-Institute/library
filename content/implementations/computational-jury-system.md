name: "Computational Jury System"
description: "In Olhahver’s paper on community currencies, jurors are not external arbiters but are drawn from multiple overlapping communities where the disputes originate. Voting power is adjusted to prioritize diverse perspectives over concentrated influence. When a decision is challenged, the appeal process triggers a multi-tiered review, with each successive tier requiring a jury composed of informationally distinct members. This structure reduces the risk of coordinated manipulation or factional bias. The approach aligns with PCARE’s proposal of leveraging plurality and subsidiarity to ensure that governance decisions reflect the collective intelligence of diverse participants rather than being dominated by concentrated interests."
