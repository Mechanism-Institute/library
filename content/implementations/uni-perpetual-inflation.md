name: "UNI Perpetual Inflation"
description: "Demonstrates a hybrid approach to inflation through its governance token UNI. The protocol launched with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, followed by a 2% perpetual inflation rate after the initial four-year distribution period. This inflation mechanism funds ongoing protocol development and governance participation while maintaining long-term value alignment. The treasury-controlled distribution enables targeted liquidity mining programs and governance initiatives, creating a balanced approach between fixed and flexible supply management."
