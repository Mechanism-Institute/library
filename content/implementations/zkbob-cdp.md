name: "zkBob CDP"
description: "Runs on the Polygon network, enabling users to mint BOB stablecoins by using Uniswap v3 and Quickswap v3 liquidity positions as collateral. Stability is maintained through monitoring bots that track CDP health and collateralization ratios, with a liquidation mechanism that employs flashloans to handle undercollateralized positions. The system uses The Graph for data querying and the 1inch API for liquidation processes to ensure adequate collateralization and support stablecoin minting against liquidity positions."
