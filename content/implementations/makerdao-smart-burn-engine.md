name: "MakerDAO Smart Burn Engine"
description: "Implemented in July 2023 to replace their buyback and burn mechanism. When the surplus buffer exceeds $50 million DAI, the engine automatically purchases MKR from Uniswap V2's DAI/MKR pool. Instead of burning the tokens, it pairs the purchased MKR with an equivalent amount of DAI from the surplus buffer and provides it as liquidity in the same pool. This mechanism is projected to acquire approximately $7 million in tokens monthly, with the goal of building deep, long-term protocol-owned liquidity that helps shield MKR from sudden price drops caused by large sells."
