name: "Uniswap"
description: "Operates through liquidity pools containing pairs of ERC-20 tokens, where prices are determined by a constant product formula (x * y = k). Traders interact directly with these pools, while liquidity providers deposit token pairs to earn fees from trades. The system automatically adjusts prices based on trading activity, with arbitrageurs helping maintain price alignment with external markets. The protocol charges trading fees (typically 0.30%) that are distributed to liquidity providers, and with Uniswap V3's introduction of concentrated liquidity, providers can now focus their capital within specific price ranges."
