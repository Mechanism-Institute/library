name: "Aragon Court"
description: "Decentralized arbitration protocol designed for DAOs within the Aragon ecosystem. It selects random jurors from a pool of staked ANJ token holders, who vote on disputes using a coherence-based mechanism (jurors are incentivized to align with the majority decision). Appeals trigger a new round with more jurors, increasing the cost and complexity of overturning a decision. The appellant must stake additional collateral, making repeated appeals financially burdensome."
