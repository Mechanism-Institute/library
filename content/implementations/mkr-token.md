name: "MKR Token"
description: "Used a two-phase buyback and burn mechanism for its governance token MKR. Initially, the protocol required DAI borrowers to pay stability fees by directly burning MKR tokens. In 2020, this was enhanced to a surplus auction system where excess DAI from stability fees is first auctioned for MKR tokens through the protocol's Flap Auctions, after which the acquired MKR is burned. This separation of fee collection from token burning allowed for more efficient price discovery and reduced friction for users who no longer need to acquire MKR to pay fees. In 2023, Maker transitioned away from buyback & burn entirely, opting instead for a buyback & make model that accumulates protocol-owned liquidity."
