name: "Lido stETH"
description: "stETH is a rebase token issued by Lido Finance. When users stake their ETH through Lido, they receive stETH in return. The balance of stETH in users' wallets increases automatically as staking rewards are accrued over time, reflecting both the rewards earned and any potential penalties for slashing. stETH is redeemable on a time-delay 1-for-1 with ETH in the system."
