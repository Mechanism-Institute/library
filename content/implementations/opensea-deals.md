name: "OpenSea Deals"
description: "Feature that enables users to trade NFTs directly with each other on the OpenSea platform. Users can propose exchanges involving up to 30 NFTs and may include Wrapped Ether (WETH) to balance the trade. This system eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, enhancing security and trust in peer-to-peer NFT transactions. The feature is powered by OpenSea’s Seaport protocol, ensuring efficient and reliable trades. Notably, while the user accepting the deal is responsible for gas fees, OpenSea does not charge additional platform fees or creator royalties for these transactions."
