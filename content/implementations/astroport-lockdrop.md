name: "Astroport Lockdrop"
description: "Implemented a two-phase token launch mechanism. Phase 1 consisted of a 7-day lockdrop where users could commit Terraswap LP tokens with lock periods of up to 1 year, with longer locks receiving higher rewards. The protocol distributed 7.5% of total ASTRO supply through this mechanism. Phase 2 featured a Liquidity Bootstrap Auction where lockdrop participants could commit their ASTRO tokens to an ASTRO-UST pool, while others could provide UST, establishing initial price discovery and liquidity. LP shares from Phase 2 were locked and vested linearly over 3 months."
