name: "Tally Optimistic Governance"
description: "As a governance tool, Tally allows DAOs to implement a tailored optimistic governance by combining its Optimistic Governor, Veto Governor, and Timelock smart contracts. Based on proposal categories, DAOs can customize opposition thresholds and challenge periods. For instance, a DAO might set a higher opposition threshold (e.g., 10%) for treasury decisions while maintaining a lower threshold (e.g., 1%) for social decisions. The system integrates with onchain execution, automatically processing proposals that survive the challenge period without sufficient opposition."
