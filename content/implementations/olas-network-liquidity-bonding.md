name: "Olas Network Liquidity Bonding"
description: "Users first provide liquidity to the OLAS-ETH Uniswap pool and then exchange their LP tokens for discounted OLAS tokens through the protocol's bonding interface. The system features a 7-day vesting period before bonded tokens become claimable, and uniquely ties bond emissions to the protocol's development rewards mechanism - as ecosystem activity and developer contributions increase, the bonding capacity adjusts proportionally. This dynamic adjustment helps moderate token inflation while ensuring liquidity incentives remain aligned with actual protocol usage and growth."
