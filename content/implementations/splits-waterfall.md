name: "Splits Waterfall"
description: "Implements the original Waterfall contract, which defines a target token (ETH or specific ERC20) and a series of tranches. Each tranche requires two parameters: an allotted amount threshold and a recipient address. The implementation requires a final \"residual\" tranche with no threshold that captures all excess funds. All contract parameters including the token type, tranche sequence, thresholds, and recipients are immutable after deployment."
