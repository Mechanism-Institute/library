name: "Truebit"
description: "Computational oracle that uses work tokens to coordinate offchain computation verification. Solvers stake tokens to submit solutions to computational tasks, while verifiers can challenge incorrect solutions. The protocol implements a two-layer verification system: a consensus layer where anyone can object to faulty solutions, and an onchain incentive mechanism ensuring fair compensation for correct computations."
