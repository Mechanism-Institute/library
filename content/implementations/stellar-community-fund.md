name: "Stellar Community Fund"
description: "The Stellar Community Fund (SCF) implemented NQG as its core funding governance mechanism, transitioning from traditional token-based voting to a reputation-weighted model. Voting power is assigned based on community trust, governance participation, and acquired Discord tiers, ensuring funds are allocated to high-impact projects rather than those with the most promotional visibility."
