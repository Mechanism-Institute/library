name: "Synthetix sETH/ETH liquidity mining"
description: "In July 2019, Synthetix initiated a four-week trial to incentivize liquidity provision for the sETH/ETH pool on Uniswap V1. Participants who staked their liquidity provider (LP) tokens received SNX rewards, initially constituting 5% of the weekly SNX staking rewards, approximately 72,000 SNX tokens per week. These rewards were distributed weekly based on each participant’s share of the total staked liquidity. The program successfully attracted significant liquidity to Synthetix’s synthetic asset pools and served as an early model for liquidity mining, where rewards were adjusted as market depth improved."
