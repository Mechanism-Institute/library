name: "AdChain"
description: "Implemented a TCR system that created a trusted whitelist of web domains for digital advertising. Publishers had to stake 1500 adTokens to apply, followed by a 7-day waiting period during which token holders could challenge the application by matching the deposit. Challenges triggered a voting period where adToken holders determined the outcome, with winning challengers receiving the applicant's deposit and a 50 adToken bonus."
