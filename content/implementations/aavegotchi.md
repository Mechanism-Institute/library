description: "GHST is sold for DAI on a bonding curve gated to users who have been approved through a centralized KYC process. GHST is a currency token that users can spend on portals and wearables. Spent GHST is split between users via rarity farming, the developer team, and the community DAO, and a portion is burned, which increases the bonding curve price."
