name: "Trustlines Network"
description: "Developed a mutual credit system on Ethereum, leveraging the Currency Network Token Factory contract to manage multiple currency networks. Users’ credit relationships were represented as bilateral credit lines recorded in smart contracts. The system incorporated a comprehensive fee structure, including capacity fees for intermediary nodes, relay fees, imbalance fees, and Ethereum transaction fees, all seamlessly managed via smart contracts. The system applied the Six-degree Theorem to ensure scalability, demonstrating that users only need a few direct connections to access the broader network. The technical architecture enabled “multi-hop” transactions by identifying paths through trusted connections, with automatic fee calculations and settlements executed directly on Ethereum."
