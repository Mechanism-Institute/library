name: "Proof of Humanity UBI"
description: "Launched as the first application built on the Proof of Humanity registry, which ran on the Ethereum blockchain. At launch, 1 UBI token was streamed per hour per verified human (720 UBI per month). 10 million UBI tokens minted at genesis with 20% allocated to early contributors, 40% for initial liquidity mining, 40% for the UBI community treasury. The distribution parameters became a subject of significant debate within the DAO up until it voted in favor of forking in 2022, highlighting the challenge of balancing fair distribution with token value stability."
