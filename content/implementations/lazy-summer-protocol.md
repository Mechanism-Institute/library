name: "Lazy Summer Protocol"
description: "Voting power decays linearly by 10% annually after a 60-day grace period. Delegation is permitted up to two levels deep, with the delegated voting power inheriting the lowest decay factor in the delegation chain. Users can reset their decay factor to full by engaging in governance activities such as proposing new governance measures, voting on existing proposals, delegating voting power, cancelling proposals, or executing governance decisions."
