name: "sDAO"
description: "Utilizes Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to randomly select a statistically representative subset of voters (\"jurors\") from the broader DAO community. The system integrates with WorldCoin for Sybil resistance, ensuring each human participant can only be selected once. Selected jurors receive financial incentives from the treasury to encourage active participation, with each juror having equal voting power regardless of token holdings. This implementation promotes community engagement by incentivizing members to stay informed about proposals, as anyone might be selected to vote. By decoupling financial stake from governance power within the selected cohort, the system aims to reduce plutocratic influences while maintaining representative decision-making through statistical sampling."
