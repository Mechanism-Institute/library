name: "KlimaDAO Liquidity Bonding"
description: "KlimaDAO applied the liquidity bond model to the voluntary carbon market, allowing users to deposit carbon-backed tokens (such as BCT) or liquidity provider (LP) tokens into the protocol’s treasury in exchange for discounted KLIMA tokens. This mechanism aimed to acquire Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) while accumulating carbon assets, positioning KLIMA as a decentralized reserve currency for carbon credits. The protocol utilized dynamic bond pricing to adjust discounts based on demand and introduced inverse bonds, which let users redeem KLIMA for treasury assets when the token traded below its intrinsic value, helping to stabilize prices. Initially, KlimaDAO experienced rapid growth, attracting significant capital and driving up demand for carbon credits. However, like Olympus DAO, its model depended heavily on continuous bond sales and high Annual Percentage Yields (APY) to sustain participation. As market conditions shifted and demand for KLIMA bonds decreased, treasury inflows declined, leading to reduced protocol revenue and mounting sell pressure. This triggered a liquidity crunch, eroding the protocol’s reserves and causing KLIMA’s price to collapse from its early highs."
