name: "Holonym Holo"
description: "Decentralized, privacy-preserving identity protocol and web app designed for user-centered identity verification. It enables users to prove two key aspects of their identity: uniqueness and singularity or specific attributes such as residency or age. To verify their identity, users connect their Web3 wallet to the Holonym web app and submit a government-issued ID or driver’s license. Alternatively, they can prove uniqueness and singularity by submitting a phone number. Verification is handled by third-party providers [Onfido](https://onfido.com/), [iDenfy](https://www.idenfy.com/), and [Veriff](https://www.veriff.com/). Once verified, users can mint Holo, a Soulbound Token (SBT) that serves as an onchain proof of their verified identity attributes."
