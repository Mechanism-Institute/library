description: "Decentralized governance platform that implements automated decision-making through dual prediction markets to evaluate proposal outcomes based on token value. It consists of three parts: (1) a dual market system that simultaneously tracks conditional token prices for proposal passage and failure, (2) an order book trading mechanism that allows direct buying and selling of outcome shares, and (3) an execution protocol that automatically implements proposals based on the price spread between conditional markets."
