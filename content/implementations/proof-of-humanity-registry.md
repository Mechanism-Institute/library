name: "Proof of Humanity Registry"
description: "TCR of unique and singular humans that operates on the Ethereum network. Before the 2022 fork of the project, users seeking inclusion in the registry would submit a video of themselves stating a specific phrase and providing their Ethereum address. The submission process required a token deposit and vouching from existing registry members. After submission, a challenge period allowed members to dispute entries by matching the submitter’s deposit. Disputes were sent to Kleros’ Humanity Court for arbitration, where jurors reviewed the evidence and voted on the outcome. If the jury ruled in favor of the challenger, the submission would be marked as “Removed,” and the challenger would receive the submitter’s deposit. If approved, the profile as added to the registry, the deposit was returned to the submitter, and the Ethereum address specified in the submission began accruing a UBI token, distributed in the fashion of a Universal Basic Income."
