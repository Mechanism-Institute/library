description: "Employs Frequent Batch Auctions (FBA) where orders are grouped together in batches. Each batch undergoes an auction and a single uniform price is chosen to maximize traded volume. Orders whose limit prices cross the uniform price are matched by price priority. If multiple orders share the same price, they participate in trades pro-rata."
