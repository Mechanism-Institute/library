name: "GoodDollar"
description: "Distributes G$ tokens daily to verified members through a sustainable funding mechanism. The protocol operates across multiple chains, with token creation on Ethereum mainnet and distribution on L2s and sidechains like Celo and Fuse to ensure accessibility and low costs. Unlike many crypto projects, GoodDollar had no pre-mint, and 80% of minted tokens go directly to UBI distribution, with new tokens minted based on deposits into the GoodReserve. The system is funded through interest generated from DeFi protocols, yield farming, and corporate support. Users must verify their identity through face verification to claim daily UBI, which is equally divided among all active claimants in a 24-hour period."
