name: "Proof of Humanity DAO"
description: "First project in Ethereum to enable one-person, one-vote. Participants must submit a video of themselves, an Ethereum address, a registration fee (to be returned upon verification) alongside a vouch from an already verified member, creating a web of trust that validates each person’s identity without central authority. Once verified as unique and singular individuals, members can participate in voting on various proposals within the DAO, each wielding equal voting power."
