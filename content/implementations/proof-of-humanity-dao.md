name: "Proof of Humanity DAO"
description: "Voted on Human Improvement Proposals (HIP) on Snapshot, where every user registered in the Proof of Humanity registry had one vote which they could cast directly or delegate to another verified user. Delegations were not transitive, making this not strictly an example of liquid democracy but delegate democracy. In 2022, the DAO decided delegations should be quadratic."
