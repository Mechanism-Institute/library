description: "Member-owned credit protocol built on Ethereum that enables uncollateralized lending through social vouching, where members can underwrite lines of credit to other member addresses. The protocol allows members to accumulate credit lines in a permissionless, crypto-native way by aggregating trust into available credit, with DAI being used for vouching across multiple accounts until actively borrowed."
