name: "Curve veCRV"
description: "Introduced the original veToken model with veCRV, implementing a system where users lock CRV tokens for one week to four years to receive voting power and economic rights. The mechanism uses a linear decay formula where voting power decreases as the lock period approaches expiration. For instance, locking 4000 CRV for one year provides the same voting power as 2000 CRV locked for two years. The system includes slope calculations and epoch tracking to manage voting power without requiring periodic user check-ins. Users can increase their lock amount or extend their lock period, but cannot withdraw tokens until the lock expires."
