name: "dOrg PairDrop"
description: "Pairdrop is a tool for running pairwise rounds. It assigns each voter a random sample of funding targets in pairs, asking participants to select the more deserving option from each pair. Behind the scenes, Pairdrop uses the BudgetBox algorithm, originally developed by Colony, to construct a preference graph and compute a normalized funding distribution across all targets. This approach ensures intelligent fund allocation even with limited voter turnout. Pairdrop also includes a Voter Scoring Script that integrates on and offchain data to weight votes based on participant activity."
