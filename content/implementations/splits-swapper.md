name: "Splits Swapper"
description: "A modular smart contract designed to programmatically swap any token received into a predefined output token, enabling streamlined onchain revenue management. It directly interacts with third-party traders via a flash mechanism, allowing traders to utilize the Swapper’s funds to generate and return the required output token. Pricing is determined using a modular Oracle interface, supporting implementations like Uniswap v3’s TWAP and future support for Chainlink, with options for scaling factors to customize pricing. Governance is flexible, with the owner able to modify settings, execute arbitrary calls, and handle unswappable tokens. This structure ensures adaptability across diverse use cases while maintaining a robust trust model suited for DAOs, multisigs, or EOAs."
