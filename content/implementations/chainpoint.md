name: "Chainpoint"
description: "An open standard protocol that enables anchoring data to multiple blockchains using Merkle trees. It allows users to generate proofs that cryptographically link specific data to a particular point in time, ensuring data integrity and existence without relying on a trusted third party. By aggregating multiple hashes into a single Merkle tree, Chainpoint efficiently batches numerous data points, reducing the number of blockchain transactions required. The root of this Merkle tree is then published to a blockchain providing a tamper-evident timestamp. Users can later verify their data by comparing their original hash to the on-chain Merkle root."
