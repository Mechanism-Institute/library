name: "Lido Dual Governance"
description: "Once proposed a dual governance model where LDO holders propose and vote on changes, and stETH holders can veto proposals. stETH holders lock their tokens in an escrow contract to trigger a veto state if their locked amount surpasses a set threshold. During the veto state, proposals passed by LDO holders cannot be executed unless approved through an anti-veto vote, where stETH holders vote for or against specific proposals. The veto remains in place until the locked stETH amount falls below the required threshold or an anti-veto vote explicitly lifts it."
