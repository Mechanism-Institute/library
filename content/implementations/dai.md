name: "DAI"
description: "Maintains a 1:1 USD peg through over-collateralization, requiring users to deposit crypto assets like ETH into Maker Vaults. Price stability is achieved through the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM), automatic liquidation of under-collateralized positions, and market arbitrage. The system mints new DAI when users deposit collateral and take loans, and burns DAI when loans are repaid, creating dynamic supply adjustment. Positions must maintain a collateralization ratio above 150% to avoid liquidation. Stability is further maintained through automated liquidations and dynamic stability fees."
