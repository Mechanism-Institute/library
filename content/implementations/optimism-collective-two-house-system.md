description: "Operates with two distinct chambers: the Token House and the Citizens' House. The Token House, composed of OP token holders, uses a token-weighted voting system and currently focuses on the allocation of the Governance Fund, all protocol and governor upgrade proposals, and proposing any changes to the inflation rate of the OP Token. The Citizens' House, comprised of selected community members who have meaningfully contributed to the ecosystem, uses a one-person, one-vote system and currently focuses on public goods funding decisions."
