name: "USDC Block List"
description: "The stablecoin's smart contract checks addresses against the block list during every transfer, effectively freezing any blacklisted account's balance and preventing future transactions. This checking process adds considerable overhead, making USDC transfers approximately 40% more expensive than comparable stablecoins like DAI, with blacklist checks consuming about 20% of the contract's overall gas fees and costing users an estimated $3.6 million monthly in late 2021. The mechanism was first publicly used in mid-2020 when CENTRE froze $100,000 in USDC in response to a law enforcement request. The scope of its use expanded significantly in 2022 when Circle blacklisted all Ethereum addresses associated with Tornado Cash following regulatory actions, demonstrating both the mechanism's power and its centralization implications."
