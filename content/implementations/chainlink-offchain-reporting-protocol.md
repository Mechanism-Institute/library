name: "Chainlink Offchain Reporting Protocol"
description: "Multiple nodes submit data for offchain reporting, which is assembled into a final report and submitted to an aggregator contract by a leader node. The contract verifies that a quorum of nodes signed the report and exposes the median value to consumers as the final result, along with a block timestamp and a round ID."
