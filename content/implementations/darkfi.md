description: "Launched in 2023, represents a multi-layered privacy architecture. The protocol combines zero-knowledge proofs at the application layer with network-level privacy through Tor integration, enabling fully anonymous smart contracts and transactions. Its architecture includes a specialized zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) and a WASM runtime that allows developers to build privacy-preserving applications using a simplified ZK assembly language. The platform implements several advanced selective disclosure techniques, including partial homomorphic encryption for anonymous swaps, Shamir secret sharing for spam protection through rate limit nullifiers, and anonymous inclusion proofs for transaction validation. This comprehensive approach ensures that both transaction details and network-level metadata remain private, while still maintaining verifiability through zero-knowledge proof."
