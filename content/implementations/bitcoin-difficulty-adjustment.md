name: "Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment"
description: "Implements a dynamic control system that adjusts mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks) to maintain a 10-minute average block time. The algorithm calculates the ratio between actual time taken for the previous 2,016 blocks and the target time (20,160 minutes), then adjusts difficulty proportionally. This mechanism has successfully maintained Bitcoin's block time target since 2009, even as network hash rate has grown from personal computers to industrial-scale mining operations."
