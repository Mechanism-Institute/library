name: "Hats Protocol"
description: "Provides a composable role management framework built on Safe, where permissions and responsibilities are embodied as NFTs (\"Hats\") assigned to addresses based on eligibility criteria. It features a hierarchical structure where top-level hats can create, revoke, and oversee lower-level hats, forming ordered responsibility chains. Each hat includes custom eligibility rules for minting and wearing, with revocation tied to conditions that may remove it if criteria shift. This builds a flexible permission system where access rights evolve with organizational and individual changes through modular design."
