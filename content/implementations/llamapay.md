name: "Llamapay"
description: "Utilizes the token stream mechanism with an open-ended model, streaming raw ERC-20 tokens (e.g., DAI) from a sender’s live balance at a fixed rate—like 0.01 DAI per second—vesting per block for instant withdrawal. No upfront deposit is required, and senders can cancel anytime; if funds deplete, it tracks debt as a negative balance, offset by later top-ups. Avoiding wrapped tokens or liquidation, this straightforward approach gives an efficient, manageable streaming option for payroll or subscriptions, prioritizing simplicity and recipient access, though it demands sender vigilance to prevent debt buildup."
