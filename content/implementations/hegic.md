description: "Implements peer-to-pool model, where liquidity providers deposit funds into pools that act as underwriters for options contracts. Users can purchase call or put options directly from these pools by specifying parameters like strike price, expiration date, and asset type. The premium paid by the buyer is automatically distributed to the liquidity providers as compensation for underwriting the options. When an option is exercised, the pool uses its collateral to settle the trade, either delivering the asset or paying the difference between the strike price and the market price."
