name: "PoolTogether"
description: "Prize savings protocol that allows users to deposit assets into prize vaults, where the yield generated from these deposits is distributed as random prizes. Participants can deposit tokens like USDC, WETH, or DAI into the vaults or swap directly into prize tokens. These deposits generate yield by interacting with lending protocols (initially Compound and now Aave V3 on Optimism). The collected yield from all deposits is pooled and awarded as prizes through daily random draws. Users can withdraw their original deposits at any time, ensuring a “no-loss” system where only the yield is used for the prizes."
