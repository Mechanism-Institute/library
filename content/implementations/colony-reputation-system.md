name: "Colony Reputation System"
description: "Proposes a system for decentralized governance where reputation is quantified based on work performed and contributions made, but unlike tokens, it cannot be transferred and must be continually earned through active participation. Reputation decays over time at a rate where it halves every approximately 3.5 months (every 600,000 blocks)."
