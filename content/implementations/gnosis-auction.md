name: "Gnosis Auction"
description: "Enables projects to conduct Initial DEX Offerings through batch auctions. The project determines the minimum price they are willing to sell their tokens for, and bidders set the maximum price they are willing to pay. At the end of the batch auction, all trades are settled based on where the buying demand and token supply meet. This way both participants get either what they were willing to receive or more."
