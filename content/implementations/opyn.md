name: "Opyn"
description: "Leverages its Gamma Protocol where options are tokenized as ERC-20 tokens called oTokens. Users can mint oTokens by locking collateral in Opyn’s smart contracts, ensuring the options are fully collateralized. Buyers can then purchase these oTokens on decentralized exchanges, representing the right to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a specific strike price by the expiration date. The mechanism ensures that if a buyer exercises the option, the collateral held in the smart contract automatically settles the trade, transferring the underlying asset or equivalent value."
