description: "Funding competition platform where people submit entries, then vote on them. Competition creators can let anyone participate or restrict access through allowlists, and set how long each phase lasts. There is also a self-funding option, where creators can direct 50% of all submission and voting fees into a reward pool, creating an incentive cycle where more participation leads to bigger prizes. Participants can earn rewards, reputation points, and credentials based on their performance, making it useful for everything from grant programs and hackathons to community decisions and idea competitions."
